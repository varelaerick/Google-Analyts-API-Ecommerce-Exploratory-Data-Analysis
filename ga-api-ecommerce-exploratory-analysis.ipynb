That will be an Exploratory Analysis and the main idea is to try to get different insights of the traffic mediums of ecommerce.\n\nExploring the transactions, getting insights of the buyers profile, buyer behavior and checking the correlation between our features and transaction.\n\nThe second part of that serie we will find the best classification model per traffic medium.

Where transactions are the minority class.\n\n\n\n\n- **Buyer Profile** - The **buyers** majority are from São Paulo. The difference is the percentile per medium. All the traffic Medium has a very high percentile of Android users. Also we can say that, the buyers used to use mobile devices in most of the mediums.\n.\n\n\n- **Transaction Hour** - The higher number of transactions of all mediums happen in the afternoon and in the night. Between 12h and 22h. Which makes the number of transactions have a strong positive correlation with the hour in all Mediums.\n\n\n\n- **Transaction Correlations** -  Hits, Minutes Session Duration, be from São Paulo, Macintosh users or Return Visitors always are in positive correlated with transaction. Also IOS Windows are almost always positively correlated with transactions. The exception is Social Medium. In the other side New visitor, Other regions and Android users are always negative correlated with the transaction.\n           \n\n\n\n\n\n**Difference**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- **The Central Tendency** - In the average of the Full Df the buyers used to buy 6 items per transaction but per medium that has a small variance. **Organic** has the smaller number of items per sale and Direct the higher one 7.64. About revenue, **Paid Search** has the higher ticket 108.82 and Organic the smaller, 86.30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- **Conversion Rate** - The **Organic** medium brings the most part of the users (186,314). Followed by **Paid Search** (169,042), **Direct** (93,036) and **Social** 114,971. About the conversion rate Direct has the higher one with 0.29%, followed by **Organic** 0.24%, **Paid Search** 0.17% and **Social** 0.15%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- **Buyer Profile** - The most common Operating System is Android in the majority of the Medium. In the **Direct** medium it changes for a small difference to IOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n- **Distribution of Buyer and non Buyers Behavior** - Here we can see that all Medium behave differently on the web site. To have an overview and highlight these differences we can look at the mode of buyers per medium. The Minute Session Duration of the Buyers for example, the lower is 10 minutes (**Direct**) and the higher is 39 minutes (**Paid Search**). The modes of the Page Depth are very different in each medium. 7 is the mode number of pages depth for **Organic** and 55 of **Paid Search**. For Hits the difference is also notable, sessions of buyers from **Direct** medium often to do 8 Hits on the site and users from **Paid Search** used to do 17 hits. Another important difference could be noted in the tables in each Traffic Medium session of the netbook but these numbers can prove the point each source medium behaves differently on the website.\n\n\n\n- **Transactions Day** -  The **Organic** medium seems to have more transactions in the first half of the month, while the rest of the medium seems to have more transactions in the second half.\n\n\n\n\n- **Transaction Correlations** -As much as we have found some patterns in the transaction correlations, the value of the **PCC** always varies considerably across the mediums.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Hypotese Test <a name=\"ht\"></a>\n\nObserving the notebook we can have a good understanding about the behavior of the customers of each traffic medium and find an hypothesis to improve the online experience of the customers.
